# mapping-tutorial
Heavily commented code to work as a tutorial for beginner R students interested in learning data visualizations with public data.

~~~ For R beginners interested in going through tutorial independently: ~~~

Welcome to R!

The purpose of this tutorial is give a very quick introduction to the language, and three foundational libraries for analysing, plotting, and mapping data & spatial data.

The endpoint of the tutorial is a map that looks like the "myplot.png" in the folder. Some options for customizing the visuals are also briefly discussed.

Most of the instruction is through comments in the code. These are preceded with hashtags (#) and tell you what the R line will do.

To go through the tutorial independently, first make sure R and RStudio are installed, then download and unzip this directory.
Open the "R air quality class.Rproj" file, then the first script.
Read through the comments and run the code--- ctrl-enter runs a line of code in RStudio. (ctrl-shift-enter runs the whole script.)
As you finish each script, move on to the next. Each is pretty short.
There are a couple exercises throughout, where you can try to use what you learned to fill in a step of the code.
Sample solutions to these exercises are in the "snippets for figure it outs.R" file.

To recreate the sample map, run that snippets in order, with the "snippets for figure it outs" run inbetween scripts 2 & 3.
